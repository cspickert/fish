## fish

### Overview

This is the [fish](http://fishshell.com) configuration I'm using on my Mac (currently under Yosemite). A lot of it is going to be specific to my own workflows, but you might find it useful, too.

You can see my old bash dotfiles [here](https://github.com/cspickert/dotfiles).

### Installing

```lang=shell
mkdir -p ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/cspickert/fish.git ~/.config/fish
```
